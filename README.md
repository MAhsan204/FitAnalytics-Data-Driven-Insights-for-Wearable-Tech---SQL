# FitAnalytics - Data-Driven Insights for Wearable Tech---SQL

## Project Overview

This project was conducted for a leading consumer electronics company that specializes in wearable fitness trackers. The company aimed to gain insights into their product offerings, compare various models, and optimize their pricing strategies. The datasets provided contain detailed information about different fitness tracker models, including their brand, specifications, pricing, and user reviews.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of the fitness tracker data to support business decisions. The company wanted to answer critical business questions through SQL queries, such as:

1. **Identifying Top-Performing Devices**: Which models are receiving the highest ratings from customers? How do these ratings correlate with the selling price and other attributes like battery life?
   
2. **Optimizing Pricing Strategies**: How does the selling price of various models compare to their original price? Which models are being sold at a significant discount, and what impact does this have on sales?

3. **Brand and Model Comparisons**: Which brands are dominating the market in terms of the number of models offered and overall customer satisfaction? What are the differences in average ratings and prices between different brands?

4. **Customer Preferences Analysis**: What are the most popular display types and strap materials among customers? How does the color of a device affect its sales and rating?

5. **Battery Life Insights**: How does the battery life of a device influence customer reviews and ratings? Which models offer the longest battery life, and are they priced accordingly?

## Key SQL Queries

To address these objectives, a series of SQL queries were developed to extract actionable insights from the data. Some of the key queries include:

- **Popular Devices**: Identifying the most popular devices based on customer ratings and reviews.
- **Price Analysis**: Comparing the selling price and original price of devices to identify those with significant discounts or price anomalies.
- **Brand Performance**: Grouping devices by brand and analyzing their performance in terms of sales, ratings, and pricing.
- **Customer Preferences**: Analyzing the most preferred device attributes such as display type, color, and strap material.
- **Battery Life Optimization**: Examining the relationship between a device’s battery life and its customer rating.

## Dataset Description

The analysis was performed on two datasets:

1. **Fitness_trackers.csv**: This dataset includes details like `Brand Name`, `Device Type`, `Model Name`, `Color`, `Selling Price`, `Original Price`, `Display`, `Rating`, `Strap Material`, `Average Battery Life (in days)`, and `Reviews`.

2. **Fitness_trackers_updated.csv**: This dataset serves as an updated version of the original file with potential changes in pricing, ratings, and additional model information.

## Project Outcomes

The insights derived from this analysis helped the company in:

- Identifying key areas for product improvement.
- Making data-driven decisions regarding pricing strategies.
- Understanding customer preferences to enhance product development.
- Targeting marketing efforts more effectively by focusing on high-performing models and popular attributes.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing large datasets to uncover business insights. By applying a range of SQL techniques—from basic queries to advanced joins and subqueries—the company was able to extract valuable information that directly supports their business objectives.
